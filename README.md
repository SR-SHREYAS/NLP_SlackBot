# AI Bot: Go, Wit.ai, Wolfram Alpha, and Slack Integration

This project implements an AI-powered Slack bot written in Go (Golang) that leverages Wit.ai for natural language understanding (NLU) and Wolfram Alpha for answering complex queries. The bot integrates seamlessly with Slack, allowing users to ask questions and receive intelligent responses directly within their chat environment.

## Technologies and Concepts Used

This section details the core technologies and libraries employed in this project, explaining their purpose and how they are integrated.

### 1. Go (Golang)

*   **Topic Name:** Go Programming Language
*   **Explanation:** Go is an open-source programming language designed by Google. It's known for its simplicity, efficiency, strong concurrency support, and excellent performance, making it ideal for building scalable network services and command-line tools.
*   **Theoretical Usage in Project:** Go serves as the foundational language for the entire bot. Its concurrency model (goroutines and channels) is implicitly used by libraries like `slacker` to handle multiple Slack events and API calls efficiently without blocking the main execution flow. The project structure, error handling, and overall logic are all implemented in Go.
*   **Core Code Block (Main Entry Point):**
    ```go
    package main

    import (
        "context"
        "log"
        "os"
        // ... other imports
    )

    func main() {
        // Load environment variables
        godotenv.Load(".env")

        // Initialize clients for Slack, Wit.ai, and Wolfram Alpha
        bot := slacker.NewClient(os.Getenv("SLACK_BOT_TOKEN"), os.Getenv("SLACK_APP_TOKEN"))
        client := witai.NewClient(os.Getenv("WIT_AI_TOKEN"))
        wolframClient = &wolfram.Client{AppID: os.Getenv("WOLFRAM_APP_ID")}

        // Start listening for Slack commands
        ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
        defer cancel()

        err := bot.Listen(ctx)
        if err != nil {
            log.Fatal(err)
        }
    }
    ```

### 2. Slack API Integration (`github.com/shomali11/slacker`)

*   **Topic Name:** Slack Bot Development with `slacker`
*   **Explanation:** `slacker` is a Go library that simplifies the process of building Slack bots. It provides an easy-to-use interface for connecting to the Slack API, registering commands, listening for events, and sending messages back to Slack channels.
*   **Theoretical Usage in Project:** This library is the primary interface for the bot to interact with Slack. It handles the WebSocket connection, parses incoming messages, matches them against defined commands, and allows the bot to send replies. The bot defines two main commands (`query for bot` and `full query for bot`) that users can invoke.
*   **Core Code Block (Command Registration and Reply):**
    ```go
    // ... inside main()
    bot := slacker.NewClient(os.Getenv("SLACK_BOT_TOKEN"), os.Getenv("SLACK_APP_TOKEN"))

    bot.Command("query for bot - <message>", &slacker.CommandDefinition{
        Description: "send any question to wolfram",
        Handler: func(botCtx slacker.BotContext, request slacker.Request, response slacker.ResponseWriter) {
            query := request.Param("message") // Extract user's message
            // ... process query with Wit.ai and Wolfram Alpha
            response.Reply("Your answer here") // Send reply back to Slack
        },
    })

    go printCommandEvents(bot.CommandEvents()) // Optional: for logging command events
    err := bot.Listen(context.Background())    // Start listening for events
    ```

### 3. Wit.ai (`github.com/wit-ai/wit-go/v2`)

*   **Topic Name:** Natural Language Understanding (NLU) with Wit.ai
*   **Explanation:** Wit.ai is a natural language processing (NLP) platform that allows developers to easily add natural language interfaces to their applications. It can extract intents and entities from user utterances, converting free-form text into structured data.
*   **Theoretical Usage in Project:** The bot uses Wit.ai to understand the user's intent and extract relevant entities from their query. Specifically, it's configured to identify a "wolfram_search_query" entity, which helps refine the user's input before sending it to Wolfram Alpha. This ensures that even if a user asks a question informally, Wit.ai can extract the core search term.
*   **Core Code Block (Parsing User Query):**
    ```go
    // ... inside a command handler
    client := witai.NewClient(os.Getenv("WIT_AI_TOKEN"))
    // ...
    msg, err := client.Parse(&witai.MessageRequest{
        Query: query, // The user's message from Slack
    })
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("error calling Wit.ai: %v", err)
        response.Reply("Sorry, I'm having trouble understanding right now.")
        return
    }
    // 'msg' now contains parsed intents and entities
    ```

### 4. Wolfram Alpha (`github.com/krognol/go-wolfram`)

*   **Topic Name:** Computational Knowledge Engine with Wolfram Alpha
*   **Explanation:** Wolfram Alpha is a computational knowledge engine that answers factual queries directly by computing the answer from structured data, rather than providing a list of documents or web pages. It can perform calculations, provide definitions, retrieve data, and generate reports across a vast range of topics.
*   **Theoretical Usage in Project:** After Wit.ai processes the user's query, the refined search term is sent to Wolfram Alpha. The bot utilizes two main Wolfram Alpha functionalities:
    *   `GetSpokentAnswerQuery`: For concise, spoken-word answers.
    *   `GetQueryResult`: For more detailed, structured reports, which can include multiple "pods" of information.
    This allows the bot to provide both quick answers and comprehensive information based on the user's command.
*   **Core Code Block (Querying Wolfram Alpha):**
    ```go
    // ... inside a command handler, after Wit.ai processing
    wolframClient = &wolfram.Client{AppID: os.Getenv("WOLFRAM_APP_ID")}
    // ...
    // For a spoken answer:
    res, err := wolframClient.GetSpokentAnswerQuery(answer, wolfram.Metric, 1000)
    if err != nil { /* handle error */ }
    response.Reply(res)

    // For a full query result (structured data):
    fullRes, err := wolframClient.GetQueryResult(answer, nil)
    if err != nil { /* handle error */ }
    // Process fullRes.Pods to extract relevant information
    ```

### 5. `godotenv` (`github.com/joho/godotenv`)

*   **Topic Name:** Environment Variable Management
*   **Explanation:** `godotenv` is a Go port of the Ruby dotenv library, which loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `os.Getenv`. This is crucial for keeping sensitive information (like API tokens) out of source control and managing configuration easily across different environments.
*   **Theoretical Usage in Project:** The bot requires several API tokens (Slack, Wit.ai, Wolfram Alpha). `godotenv` is used at the very beginning of the `main` function to load these tokens from a `.env` file, making them accessible via `os.Getenv()` throughout the application.
*   **Core Code Block (Loading Environment Variables):**
    ```go
    package main

    import (
        "github.com/joho/godotenv"
        // ...
    )

    func main() {
        godotenv.Load(".env") // Loads variables from .env file
        // Now os.Getenv("SLACK_BOT_TOKEN") etc. will work
        // ...
    }
    ```

### 6. `gjson` (`github.com/tidwall/gjson`)

*   **Topic Name:** Fast JSON Parsing
*   **Explanation:** `gjson` is a Go package for getting values from JSON quickly. It uses a simple path syntax to query JSON, making it very efficient for extracting specific pieces of data without needing to unmarshal the entire JSON structure into Go structs.
*   **Theoretical Usage in Project:** After receiving the JSON response from Wit.ai, the bot needs to extract the `wolfram_search_query` entity's value. `gjson` is used here to efficiently navigate the potentially complex JSON structure and retrieve this specific piece of information.
*   **Core Code Block (Extracting Value from JSON):**
    ```go
    // ... after client.Parse() returns 'msg'
    data, err := json.MarshalIndent(msg, "", "    ") // Convert Wit.ai response to JSON bytes
    if err != nil { /* handle error */ }

    rough := string(data[:]) // Convert bytes to string
    // Use gjson to extract the specific entity value
    value := gjson.Get(rough, "entities.wit$wolfram_search_query:wolfram_search_query.0.value")

    answer := query // Fallback
    if value.Exists() {
        answer = value.String() // Use the extracted value if it exists
    }
    // 'answer' is now ready for Wolfram Alpha
    ```

## Flow of Execution

1.  **Initialization:** The bot starts, loads environment variables from `.env`, and initializes clients for Slack, Wit.ai, and Wolfram Alpha.
2.  **Listen for Commands:** The `slacker` client connects to Slack and begins listening for messages that match its registered commands (e.g., `query for bot - <message>`).
3.  **User Input:** A user types a command in Slack, e.g., `@bot query for bot - what is the capital of france`.
4.  **Command Handling:** The `slacker` library captures the message and invokes the corresponding `Handler` function. The user's `<message>` part is extracted as `query`.
5.  **Natural Language Understanding (Wit.ai):** The `query` is sent to Wit.ai for parsing. Wit.ai analyzes the text to identify intents and entities (e.g., `wolfram_search_query` with value "capital of france").
6.  **Entity Extraction (`gjson`):** The JSON response from Wit.ai is processed using `gjson` to extract the refined search query. If Wit.ai doesn't provide a specific entity, the original query is used as a fallback.
7.  **Knowledge Retrieval (Wolfram Alpha):** The refined search query is then sent to Wolfram Alpha.
    *   For `query for bot`, `GetSpokentAnswerQuery` is used for a direct answer.
    *   For `full query for bot`, `GetQueryResult` is used for a more detailed, structured response.
8.  **Response to Slack:** The answer received from Wolfram Alpha is formatted (if necessary, especially for full queries) and sent back to the Slack channel using `response.Reply()`.

## Future Goals

*   **More Sophisticated NLU:** Implement more complex Wit.ai intents and entities to handle a wider range of user requests beyond just Wolfram Alpha queries (e.g., greetings, specific bot commands).
*   **Multi-turn Conversations:** Add context management to allow the bot to remember previous interactions and engage in more natural, multi-turn conversations.
*   **Error Handling and User Feedback:** Provide more user-friendly error messages and suggestions when an API call fails or a query cannot be answered.
*   **Interactive Slack Components:** Utilize Slack's Block Kit to send richer, interactive messages (e.g., buttons, dropdowns) instead of just plain text.
*   **Modular Command Structure:** Refactor command handlers into separate files or modules for better organization as the bot grows.
*   **Caching:** Implement a caching mechanism for frequently asked questions to reduce API calls and improve response times.
*   **Testing:** Add unit and integration tests for robustness.
